# Installs (skipping anything already on PATH):
#   - the Rust toolchain pinned by rust-toolchain.toml (via rustup)
#   - wasm-tools, wac, just (via cargo-binstall, versions pinned below;
#     cargo-binstall itself arrives as a release asset pinned by version
#     and digest — scripts/cargo-binstall.sha256 — never via a floating
#     bootstrap script)
#   - pnpm (via npm, version pinned below)
#   - JS dependencies for the package trees (skipped with SKIP_NODE=1);
#     the JS package trees carry no compiled toolchain (deltic arrives as
#     pinned release assets, componentize-js as a verified binary), so
#     installs run no cargo build
#
# Prerequisites it does NOT install: rustup itself, Node 24+ and npm.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   WASM_TOOLS_VERSION, WAC_VERSION, JUST_VERSION, PNPM_VERSION
#                 - tool version pins
#   SKIP_NODE=1   - skip all JS installs
#
# CI runs this same script rather than duplicating install steps.
